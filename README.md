# Description
**This script was made for automatically clicking the "Claim Key" button**

I made this because I was annoyed of loosing my time because I checked regularly if the giveaway had already started or not. 

**What this script can:**
* Click the button if it exists
* Reload the page if it does not

**What this script cannot:**
* skip the waiting room

**Requirements:**
* Be already logged in
* Not be in the waiting room (the script doesn't know (yet?) if you are in the waiting room or not. It will continue refreshing the page, which may or may not have an impact on your placement in the waiting line

**How can you use this script:**

If you know Steelseries is doing a giveaway today, activate this acript. This way, you won't get into the waiting room. The script will then automatically refresh the page every 20 seconds and clikc the button when it appears. Just let your PC on.
